# React + Vite ✨🚀🔥

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React Fixed Header and Footer with Tailwind CSS 🚀

A simple React layout featuring a fixed header and footer using Tailwind CSS. The header remains fixed at the top, while the footer stays at the bottom when the content is less than the screen height, and moves down with the content when it's greater. Perfect for responsive designs.

## Demo 🎥

Here is the demo link: [layout](https://page-layout-demo.netlify.app/)

## Features ✨

- 📌 Fixed header at the top of the page.
- 📍 Footer sticks to the bottom of the screen when content is less than screen height.
